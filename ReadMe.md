# Notes for my "Litle Game"
## Platform & Environment
- The full game was designed on:
    + Unity 19.3.11f
    + Windows 10 : 1903
- It should run well on any windows 10 PC;
- It does not need extra environment.
## Softwares (used to build it)
### Unity
- version : 19.3.11f
- The game is based on Unity. Apart from using it as a physical engine, I used it to creat the screen, some of the characters and the particle effects. It was also used to manage the source codes and materials.
### Visual Studio 2019 Community
- It was used for programing. (I used C#)
### PhotoShop
- The face of the main character is drawed with PS.
### Blender 
- Part of the characters' body was build by this.
## The work I did
- In all, the full game was build by myself (Except for those provided by Unity). Therefore I tried to simplify all parts of this prototype except for the paograming part.
